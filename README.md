# N5-SlabCalculator

A home imporvement centre wants a program to calculate the cost of slabs a customer will need to pave a section of garden


### The Task

Write a program to calculate the number of slabs required and the total cost. The program should:

1. Get the user to input two whole numbers of slabs (width in slabs and length in slabs)
2. Multiply the two numbers together to calculate the total number of slabs
3. Get the user to input the price of a single slab
4. Multiply the total number of slabs by the cost of a slab to calculate the total cost
5. Display the results, total number of slabs and total cost 

There is no need for validation of the data input at this time

Write the Java in Main.java 

## The Algorithm Design

**Step 1:** Get width in slabs as an integer from the keyboard \
**Step 2:**	Get length in slabs as an integer from the keyboard\
**Step 3:** calculate totalSlabs lengthInSlabs * widthInSlabs\
**Step 4:**	Get cost of slab as a real from the keyboard\
**Step 5:** calculate totalCost = totalSlabs * cost of slab\
**Step 6:**	Display message and the total slabs and totalCost\

Test your program and submitt through a version control commit!
